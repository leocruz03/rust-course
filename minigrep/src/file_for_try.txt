A method without root, that works even with new Android versions:

Prerequisites:

Linux, Windows or Mac
USB cable for your device
Android Device
Instructions:

Install your device driver for using adb. Everything you need will you find here
Download adb executable for your OS. It is part of the Android SDK, but you might be able to find the adb executable individually.
Connect your android device.
Enable the developer options.
Enable USB debugging.
Open a command promt (windows) or terminal (linux / mac). How to do it: On Windows: windows + r > enter "cmd" (without quotes) > click enter | On Linux: You don't know how to open a terminal? LOL | On Mac: Type Terminal into Spotlight and open it
CD to the directory where the adb executable is located. On Windows: Go to the directory where you downloaded the adb executable, Shift+Right Click and select "Open Console" (or similar) | On Linux / Mac: Rightclick in the directory and select "Open Terminal here" (or simply CD into the directory)
Type in your cmd/terminal: adb devices to verify your device is properly connected.
If your device is properly selected, type in adb logcat to show the mighty and magic logcat aka stacktrace.
Reproduce your error (or whatever) on your device.
Right after, paste the whole cmd / terminal window into a paste-service like http://pastebin.com/ and send it to us.
